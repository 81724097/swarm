<p>Nightbugs wriggle and glow when exposed to the energy of your nexus. Gather nightbugs near your nexus to store additional energy.</p>
<p>Your nightbugs store up to {{(unit.effect[0].calcStats().capMult - 1) * 100 | number:2}}% more maximum energy. Hatching more can increase this to a maximum of {{(unit.effect[0].val - 1) * 100 | number:0}}%.</p>
